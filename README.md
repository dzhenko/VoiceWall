## VoiceWall

**VoiceWall** is a open-source ASP NET MVC 5 Application.

This simple application takes social media communication to the next level. 
Writing on your phone has always been more of a annoyance - instead the only way to share and communicate is via media - you can post or comment other posts only via voice, video or pictures. 
Users (after logging in via local account or other social account) can create, read, comment, like, hate or flag other comments and posts. A simple chat is also introduced (in case users miss typing or in case you are stuck at work and are unable to say what you want to say). In case you get bored there is the "Give me a random joke .. and it better be a good one" button and a single game implemented. 
There are moderators in the application - they can hide inappropriate posts or comments (those which gathered many flags). 
Needless to say administrators in this application are like gods over all the data. All of this is described in the About page of the application. 
Enjoy :)
